# Deep Forward Networks Pytorch Project
 This repository contains resources for the seminar Deep Learning Concepts at the University of Osnabr√ºck (2024/2025), led by Lukas Niehaus and Robin Rawiel. The repository includes a presentation and code to introduce foundational theory and practical examples of Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs), based on the first chapter of the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.  This work is prepared by Iheb Marouani and Zuzanna Bojarska to provide an accessible yet comprehensive introduction to FFNNs, covering both theoretical insights and hands-on examples.

# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites
